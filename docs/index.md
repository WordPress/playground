# WordPress Playground

WordPress Playground is a WordPress running in the browser without a PHP server.

## Getting started

[Try the demo](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/demo/) to experiment with an anonymous WordPress website where you can test-drive plugins and themes.

### Embedding the WordPress Playground demo

You can embed WordPress Playground using an iframe. **Note this is an experimental feature that may break or change without a warning.**

```html
<iframe
    style="width: 800px; height: 500px;"
    src="https://wasm.wordpress.net/wordpress.html?mode=seamless"
></iframe>
```

Learn more about the configuration options and JavaScript API at [embedding WordPress Playground on other websites](./embedding-wordpress-playground-on-other-websites.md).

### Setting up your local development environment

To customize WordPress Playground and build on top of it, you will need to work directly with the GitHub repository. Don't worry, **you don't need to know WebAssembly.** Most of the meaningful work happens in the JavaScript and PHP land.

Start by creating a local development environment:

```js
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground
cd wordpress-playground
npm install
npm run dev
```

A browser should open and take you to your very own WordPress Playground at `http://127.0.0.1:8777/wordpress.html`!

Any changes you make to `.ts` files will be live-reloaded. Changes to `Dockerfile` require a full rebuild.

## Architecture overview

Here's a high-level breakdown of how WordPress Playground works:

* `wordpress.html` starts a Worker Thread and a ServiceWorker
* The Worker Thread starts PHP and populates the filesystem with a WordPress patched to run on SQLite
* The ServiceWorker starts intercepting all HTTP requests and forwarding them to the Worker Thread
* `wordpress.html` creates an `<iframe src="/index.php">` where the WordPress homepage is rendered

Visually, it looks like this:
