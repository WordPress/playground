const client = await connectPlayground(
	document.getElementById('wp')! as HTMLIFrameElement,
	`https://wasm.wordpress.net/remote.html`
);
await client.isReady();
await client.goTo('/wp-admin/');

const result = await client.run({
	code: '<?php echo "Hi!"; ',
});
console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(result.body));
```
