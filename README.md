WordPress.wasm is a client-side WordPress that runs without a PHP server thanks to the magic of WebAssembly.

## Why is WordPress.wasm useful?

I'm glad you asked – WordPress.wasm is a big deal!

It can power:

-   Runeditable code examples in your documentation or course
-   Plugin and theme demos in a private WordPress instance where the user is already logged in as admin
-   Easily switching PHP and WordPress version when testing
-   Replaying and fixing the failed CI tests right in the browser

WordPress.wasm provides a strong foundation for the above use-cases but does not implement them just yet. This project is still in its early days and needs contributors. Become a contributor today and help us make these tools a reality!

See
[the WordPress.org blog post](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/23/client-side-webassembly-wordpress-with-no-server/) to learn about the vision, other use-cases, and the visuals.

## Getting started

You can run WordPress.wasm as follows:

```js
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-wasm
cd wordpress-wasm
npm install
npm run dev
```

A browser should open and take you to your very own client-side WordPress at http://127.0.0.1:8777/wordpress.html!

As of today, the best way to play with WordPress.wasm is to directly modify the cloned files – [packages/wordpress-wasm/](./packages/wordpress-wasm) is a good place to start.

Why aren't there any npm packages? This is a new project and didn't get there yet – all the efforts were focused on getting it to work. If you'd like to see public npm packages sooner than later, you are more than welcome to contribute.
