## Local Development Environments with WordPress Playground

Playground powers offers several development environments designed to streamline the process of setting up and managing WordPress sites.

The easiest way to set up a WordPress site is to open a [public Playground web instance](../../main/web-instance.md) from https://playground.wordpress.net/ (you could also [host your own WordPress Playground](../23-architecture/18-host-your-own-playground.md)).

But Playground also provides additional tools to establish a WordPress environment designed to enhance the development experience by prioritizing ease of installation and usability:

-   [`wp-now`](./01-wp-now.md) - CLI tool to spin up a WordPress site with a single command

-   [Visual Studio Code Extension](./02-vscode-extension.md) - Integrates WordPress development directly into Visual Studio Code to get a seamless development experience within the popular code editor.

-   [WordPress Playground in Node.js](./03-php-wasm-node.md) - As a WebAssembly project, you can also use WordPress Playground in Node.js.
