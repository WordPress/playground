# Code Contributions

A guide on how to get started contributing code to the WordPress Playground project.

## Development Hub

The WordPress Playground project uses GitHub for managing code and tracking issues. The main repository is at: [https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground).

Browse [the issues list](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues) to find issues to work on. The [good first issue](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) labels are good starting points.

## Working with the GitHub repository

```js
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground
cd wordpress-playground
npm install
npm run dev
```
