# Build

Create and learn WordPress quickly—even on mobile with no signal. Use Playground where you work best, whether that’s in the browser, Node.js, mobile apps, VS Code, or elsewhere.

-   Install WordPress [in a single click](#).
-   [Build a block theme](https://youtu.be/gKrij8V3nK0?si=Jz7Dhe3RvxUMl9Cn&t=2488) in your browser and save it to GitHub.
-   Integrate with [Open AI](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2023/05/08/translate-live-updates-to-the-translation-playground/) and [CLI apps](../../developers/05-local-development/03-php-wasm-node.md) to create new tools.
