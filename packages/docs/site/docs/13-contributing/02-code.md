# Code Contributions

The WordPress Playground project uses GitHub for managing code and tracking issues. The main repository is at: [https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground).

To contribute Pull Requests, you'll need to fork the Playground repository and clone it to your local machine. You can then create a branch, make changes, and submit a pull request.

Once you have a fork, you can clone it as follows â€“ just replace `WordPress/wordpress-playground` with your GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
git clone -b trunk --single-branch --depth 1 git@github.com:WordPress/wordpress-playground.git
cd wordpress-playground
nvm use # You'll need Node 16 or later
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it, WordPress Playground is now running on your machine and you're ready to contribute!

Browse [the issues list](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues) to find issues to work on. The [good first issue](https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) labels are good starting points.

Be sure to also review the following resources:

## HTTPS setup

Some Playground features, like multisite, require a local test domain running via HTTPS.

One way to get it set up is with [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet).

Once your Valet is installed, run:

```bash
valet proxy playground.test http://localhost:5400 --secure
```

Your dev server is now available via https://playground.test.
