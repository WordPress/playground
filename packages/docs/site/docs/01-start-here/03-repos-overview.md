## [WordPress Playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/)
This is the main repository for the WordPress Playground. It contains the core codebase, issues and discussions about the project. 


Opening issues in the WordPress Playground repository for the "online" version of the Playground, IE: playground.wordpress.net, is a great way to get visibility on a problem or feature request. But there may be a better suited repo below to open the issue, and we'll discuss that shortly.

Over time many issues will be discussed in the primary repository. If you are new to using Playground and trying it online, try searching for any issue you may be having in the main repo.

## [Blueprints Library](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints-library)
A software library to work with Blueprints.

The Blueprints Library repository represents active development on parsing and creating blueprints, and will contain the `PHP`-based - [version 2](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/1025) - of Blueprints when development is complete.

You will find mostly top-level discussion about the interworkings of blueprints here. 

Eventually, the Blueprints Library will represent a robust and useful tool for managing Playgrounds, that will be merged into WordPress Core.

Please share your feedback: 
- Share your thoughts and ideas in the [Blueprints v2 Specification](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/issues/6) issue â€“ or any other issue that interests you
- Start new discussions
- Propose changes through comments and pull requests

## [Blueprints Community](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints)
The WordPress Blueprints Community Gallery is a place for users to share their Blueprints with others. It's a great place to find inspiration for your own projects, or to learn from others who have already created Blueprints.

The Blueprints Community is a collection of pre-configured setups that can be used to quickly create a new WordPress site in the Playground. Each blueprint contains a set of instructions for setting up a specific type of WordPress site, along with the necessary configuration files. We would very much value your blueprint submission!

There's a very simple contribution flow to adding your own blueprint, the [Blueprints Crash Course](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/blob/blueprints-crash-course/docs/index.md), and of course the [Blueprints Gallery](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/blob/blueprints-crash-course/GALLERY.md) to check out for ideas. Readers are encouraged to [Submit a Blueprint](https://github.com/adamziel/blueprints/blob/blueprints-crash-course/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the Gallery, and to share their thoughts on the Blueprints Community.

Submitting Issues with Blueprints is perfectly acceptable here, unless it seems more pertinent to submit the blueprint to one of the other repositories. For instance, if you're using one of the Playground Tools or seeing a general error with the Playground, the other repositories may be better suited to raise the issue. 

When searching for issues with blueprints, it is recommend to check all the pertinent, and search for terms that best describe the error or feature you are looking for.
