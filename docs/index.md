# WordPress Playground

WordPress Playground is a WordPress running in the browser without a PHP server.

Try out the [WordPress Playground demo](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/demo/) to:

* Test-drive plugins and themes
* Experiment with an anonymous WordPress website
* Embed a real WordPress site in your tutorial or course

## Getting started

You can bring WordPress Playground to your project in a few different ways:

* Embed WordPress Playground on your website via an iframe
* Customize the preinstalled WordPress
* Extend and contribute to WordPress Playground

### Embed WordPress Playground on your website via an iframe

<!-- include /docs/using-wordpress-in-the-browser.md#Embedding WordPress Playground on other websites -->

The public WordPress Playground available at [https://wasm.wordpress.net/wordpress.html](https://wasm.wordpress.net/wordpress.html) may be embedded on other websites via the `<iframe>` HTML tag as follows:

```html
<iframe
    style="width: 800px; height: 500px;"
    src="https://wasm.wordpress.net/wordpress.html?mode=seamless"
></iframe>
```

Notice how the URL says `mode=seamless`. This is a configuration option that turns off the "browser UI" and gives WordPress the entire available space.

Here are all the supported configuration options:

* `mode=seamless` or `mode=browser` – Displays WordPress on a full-page or wraps it in a browser UI
* `login=1` – Logs the user in as an admin.
* `page=/wp-admin/` – Load the specified initial page displaying WordPress
* `plugin=coblocks` – Installs the specified plugin. Use the plugin name from the plugins directory URL, e.g. for a URL like `https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lazy-loading/`, the plugin name would be `wp-lazy-loading`. You can pre-install multiple plugins by saying `plugin=coblocks&plugin=wp-lazy-loading&…`. Installing a plugin automatically logs the user in as an admin.
* `theme=disco` – Installs the specified theme. Use the theme name from the themes directory URL, e.g. for a URL like `https://wordpress.org/themes/disco/`, the theme name would be `disco`. Installing a theme automatically logs the user in as an admin.
* `rpc=1` – Enables the experimental JavaScript API.

For example, the following code embeds a Playground with a preinstalled Gutenberg plugin, and opens the post editor:

```html
<iframe
    style="width: 800px; height: 500px;"
    src="https://wasm.wordpress.net/wordpress.html?plugin=gutenberg&url=/wp-admin/post-new.php&mode=seamless"
></iframe>
```

<!-- /include /docs/using-wordpress-in-the-browser.md#Embedding WordPress Playground on other websites -->

The embedded iframe can be controlled via an experimental JavaScript API. Learn more at the [Running WordPress in the browser documentation page](./using-wordpress-in-the-browser.md#).

### Customize the preinstalled WordPress

You can customize the built-in WordPress installation to get more freedom than the embedded Playground has to offer. This is the right path to choose if you want to:

* Use a specific WordPress version
* Directly control the Playground iframe contents
* Preload a plugin or theme that's not in the directory
* Load a preconfigured WordPress instead of configuring it after the page load

To get started, create a local development build of WordPress Playground:

```js
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground
cd wordpress-playground
npm install
npm run dev
```

A browser should open and take you to your very own WordPress Playground at `http://127.0.0.1:8777/wordpress.html`!

You can now customize the WordPress installation by adjusting [the build script](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/trunk/packages/wordpress-playground/wordpress) and rebuilding WordPress with `npm run build:wp`. Learn more at the [WordPress in the browser documentation page](./using-wordpress-in-the-browser.md#).

### Extend and contribute to WordPress Playground

Custom apps may require features that are not available in WordPress Playground yet. That's an excellent opportunity to contribute to this project.

**You don't need to know WebAssembly to extend WordPress Playground.** WebAssembly knowledge is useful for altering the PHP interpreter, e.g. adding a custom PHP extension, but most of the meaningful work happens in the JavaScript in PHP land.

You could build an interactive code editor using just PHP and JavaScript. Or you could build a staging website environment where users can try out new plugins before adding them to the live website. In fact, almost every [open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues) can be addressed with JavaScript and PHP.

To get started, create a local development build of WordPress Playground:

```js
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground
cd wordpress-playground
npm install
npm run dev
```

A browser should open and take you to your very own WordPress Playground at `http://127.0.0.1:8777/wordpress.html`!

From here, the [API Reference](./api) and the architecture overview below will help you find your way.

## Architecture overview

### Running WordPress in the browser

The `wordpress-playground` package uses [php-wasm](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/trunk/docs/using-php-in-javascript.md) and [php-wasm-browser](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/trunk/docs/using-php-in-the-browser.md) to run WordPress fully in the browser and without a PHP server. It consists of:

-   Embeddable playground web page
-   WordPress web bundler
-   WordPress-specific setup for the Worker Thread and the Service Worker
-   WordPress-specific automations for tasks like signing in or installing plugins
-   A PHP proxy to download plugins and themes from the WordPress.org directory

See [running WordPress in the browser](./using-wordpress-in-the-browser.md) to learn more.

### Running PHP in the browser

The `php-wasm-browser` package provides tools to run `php-wasm` in the browser:

![The boot sequence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wordpress/wordpress-playground/trunk/docs/boot-sequence.png)

It consists of:

-   Tools to load PHP and any dependencies over the internet.
-   A Worker Thread implementation to offload the PHP runtime to.
-   A Service Worker implementation to route the browser traffic to PHP.
-   A messaging layer to wire all the processes together.
-   PHP initialization progress monitor.

See [running PHP in the browser](./using-php-in-the-browser.md) to learn more.

### Running PHP in JavaScript

The `php-wasm` package enables running PHP in JavaScript. It consists of:

-   PHP to WebAssembly build pipeline
-   JavaScript bindings to run the WebAssembly PHP
-   PHP server implementation in JavaScript

See [running PHP in Javascript](./using-php-in-javascript.md) to learn:

-   How does the WebAssembly PHP work?
-   How to customize the PHP installation?
-   How to control the PHP runtime in JavaScript?
-   How to create and delete files in the PHP filesystem?
-   How does the PHPServer class work?
